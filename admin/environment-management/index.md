Administrative users can modify a variety of environment-related behaviors.

- From the Coder UI's **Manage** > **Admin** > **Infrastructure** tab, you can enable
  and configure the following features:

  - [GPU Acceleration](gpu-acceleration.md)

- You can also modify the [Environment Shutdown
  Behavior](shutdown.md) on a per-organization basis to optimize
  resource usage.

- You can [disable SSH access](ssh-access.md) for your
  end-users by editing the YAML file in helm (by default, Coder enables SSH
  access to environments).
