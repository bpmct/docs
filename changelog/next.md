### Breaking Changes ‚ùó

- The deprecated `Services` feature is now **removed**. All resources created
  for Services are preserved for data recovery purposes (volumes,
  database tables, etc.), but are not accessible through the Coder platform.
  Please reference
  [Docker in Environments](https://coder.com/docs/environments/cvms) for
  a guide on the new workflow for running containers with your Environment.
- The built-in Internal Extension Marketplace is now **removed**. All resources
  created for this feature are preserved for data recover purposes, but are not
  accessible through the Coder platform. For air-gapped deployments, the `Custom`
  Extension Marketplace configuration enables the use of
  [Open VSX](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx) as
  an alternative. For more details, please view our [migration guide](TODO).
